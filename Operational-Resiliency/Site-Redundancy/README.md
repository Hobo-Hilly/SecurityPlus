# Summary
- "This is all about failover."
- This is really kind of like a disaster recovery type of endeavor here.
-  might seem extreme but what if you're in California, where you're on the San Andreas fault line, right? Well what happens if the building crumbles
- I don't wish any of that on anybody but we have to have something in place to make sure that we have that operational resiliency. A lot of times it's just called business continuity
- We want to make sure that the business survives in case of a disaster.

When we say backing up your hard drive, what are you doing? You're making sure and ensuring that the data that you really need access to, you have a copy of it in case that hard drive fails, you can restore from the backup, right? Well, that's the same thing these sites are, 

NOTE: All of these sites are Backup Facilities

Hot site
- Backup Facility
Fully Equipped w/ configurations for all of the follwing
- Servers storage
- Network Devices
- Telephony systems 

Hot sites that they would literally roll out to a disaster zone. But we could go with tables, desks, maybe even paper and pencil, all right. We've got everything we need that if something happens, well, we can instantly or close, maybe not instantly, but we have that site ready to go.

Cold site
- Backup Facility
- No devices of any kind
- A cold site is really nothing more than office space. All right, it could be an empty building. It might not even be an empty building. It might be a prospective building

Warm site
- Backup Facility
- May have a few devices around the backup facility.
- Could be mostly equipped
- No matter what devices are there they will ALL require configuration. Probably a lot of configuration depending.

Location, Location, Location

- Main Office on one side of the Country and your Disaster Recovery locations in another. 
- Pay attention to how far the staff would have to travel to get there
- Is the surrounding aread hospitable for employees

# SPECIAL PSA : )
Out of all the important stuff I have learned over the hundreds of hours on this sercurity learning platform. I believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the most important concept to learn so read it twice! 

I wanted to kinda camp out on the idea of that report, because it is so important to understand that the REPORT is the thing that an organization has paid for for you to do. 

If you are going into penetration testing, they don't care how cool the hacker you are and all the great exploits you know, and how to work, they want the report that tells them where are my problems and how can I fix them. This is the most important phase as a professional penetration tester. 

Why would we want to perform penetration testing?
- "Allows you to do is essentially test an organization's resilience or resistance to external attacks"
- When we look at it, we wanna be able to find things like exploitable vulnerabilities in our security systems.

# Whats the difference between a vulnerability assessment and penetration test?
With a penetration test you are finding exploitable vulnerabilities. If you just were finding vulnerabilities that would basically be a vulnerability assessment. That is the difference between a vulnerability assessment and penetration test. Is with a pen test, you actually attempt to exploit set vulnerabilities that you find.

    Using an attacker mindset and techniques to exploit an organizations vulnerabilities

Penetration testing
    White-box  (Internal Threat)
Full knowledge of the environment
-Platforms/systems
-Configuration
-Operating Systems
-network topologies
-Security implementations/controls

    Black-box
Completely unknown environment
-External threat
-No knowledge of the environment
-requires recon and discovery
-ideally testers should have similar skill levels as the attacker that the co. is facing.

If you're trying to get somebody to test to find the weaknesses, if they don't have a comparable skill level to those people that would actually be leveraging attacks against your organization. Then this was a purposeless exercise.   


    Gray-box
Partial knowledge of the environment
- Middle of the road
- uses both black and gray-box elements

Defines the parameters of the test
 - Scoping

  Timeline for the test
  When the test will proceed

  Third-party concerns

# Consider this ..
One of the things I'm thinking about is testing your networks. If you're coming from the outside, there's a chance that you might be going over an ISP's network. Are you allowed to do that? >> Yeah. >> Probably not. Not without some kind of agreement and forewarned knowledge, if that at all.

Phases of Penetration test

1. Reconnaissance
    
    2. initial access

        3. Privilege Escalation

            4. Pivoting/Lateral movement

                5. Persistence

                    6. Reporting 

                        7. Cleanup

-Closing out the Pentest
-Returning All systems to their baseline state
-Removing tools/ back doors

- Responsible disclosure programs
- Outside testing
- Discover vulnerabilities
-Providers incentive to testers

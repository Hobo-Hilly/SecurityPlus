Exercise types

Red-team
    Offensive Security
    Testing defense mechanism and resiliency to external attacks
    Test/improves the capabilities of the defense mechanisms
    Identify and exploit vulnerabilities
    Physical, hardware, software and human vulnerabilities
    Help address and fix identified security vulnerabilities
    Typically not part of the company
    Skill examples
        computer systems and protocols
        software development skills
        penetration testing
        Communication interception
        Social engineering skills

        Burpsuite

# Summary
You'll hear people use the term red team to explain that I'm a red teamer. But a true red teamer someone who is on a red team that does Red Team exercises, like what we're talking about today is a very specific type of offensive security professional. 

And they operate in teams, they have a much different scope than what a penetration tester or vulnerability assessor, they're very much more left to their own devices to do whatever they think is necessary to gain access to the systems. That's the difference between using the term red team generally versus the specific job role of a red teamer very important distinction

================================================================

* Yes, they're both identifying potential vulnerabilities. One is doing it to exploit those vulnerabilities. The blue team here on the other hand is doing it to do monitoring, detection, and reaction.

*  We're not against each other that's not the idea. If you have that idea, throw that away it's garbage. We are working with the blue team, we're just acting as an adversary so that we can help them be better. The end of the day blue team ultimately our goal is that they win and that we close all our security vulnerabilities. 

Blue-team
    Defensive security
    Identify potential vulnerabilities
    But instead of exploiting the vulnerabilities, they seek to avoid, deter, resist an respond to threats
    Think of it a monitoring, detection and reaction (what countermeasure need to be in place or upgrade, reconfigured)
    Detect block mitigate
    Usually part of the company
    IDS, IPS, packet analysis, log/packet aggregation
    EDR (endpoint detection and response)
    Honey-pots
    Skill examples
        Security strategy
        Analysis skills
        Hardening techniques
        System detection tools
        knowledge of computer networks

# What do you mean computing?

Knowing computing, right, having a thorough understanding of computing networks, network communication, we have to know what we're protecting right, in a security mindset. 
If you don't know what it is that's going on/ happening on your networks, how can you protect it if you don't have those foundational skills? 
To know that this is a computer, this computer talks to this networks use these protocols, right goes through this connectivity device uses this operating system, this operating system has to be patched in a certain way and this way, then you're not going to really be able to secure, your infrastructure from these threats.


Red-team/blue-team discussions
    Red-team discusses the attack methods used, actions take
    Blue-team can use this information to evalute and prioritize changes to prevent another similiar attack from being successful.
    Lack of sharing information of attack techniques and tools gave rise to the "purple team"


Purple-team
    Red and blue teams working in unison
    Both teams fully debrief each other
    Both teams sharing information like
        Attack techniques
        Attack tools
        Finding and outcomes


White-team
    Responsible for refereeing the red team/blue team engagement
    Observes the excerise
    Scores the exercise
    Resolve disputes between the red/blue team
    The judges of that enforce the RoE
    Derive the lessons-learned
    Accurate post-exercise/engagement assessment

# NOTE: I am constantly trying new ways to take notes and sometimes it gets weird. My bad just giving you a heads up. :) 
# Sometimes they include some notes and sometimes they don't. This is the first time I have gotten notes from then that did not match the epsiode and the content on screen. Notes are still good I just had to add a lot of extras. So the bottom half of the notes will look out of place if you go back and watch the video that matches these notes.

Episode: Vulnerability


We are going to try and answer a few key questions in this episode.

Why would we want to perform penetration testing?
What can we get out of that vulnerability scan?
What types of scans when it comes to vulnerability assessments generically regardless of the platform that you're using that we can perform on our network?

Scan Results

SCAN RESULT                 CHARACTERISTICS
False Positive                  Incorrectly indentified a vulnerability as existent
                                    (false positives, says, we thought it was there but it's not.)
False Negative                  Incorrectly indentified a vulnerability as
                                        (false negative, says, we thought it wasn't there but it was.)
True Positive                   Correctly indentified a vulnerability as existent
                                    (true positive, says, we thought there was a vulnerability and there was)

True Negative                   Correctly indentified a vulnerability as non-existente
                                                (true negative, says, we thought there was no vulnerability and there was not)

# Summary
These are the guidelines and fact checking that takes place during a vulnerability assesment.
So know the difference between these four outcomes, these four possibilities in your scan results and it'll do you well, plus a lot of good in the real world.

==================================================================================
Credentialed scan Vs. Non-credentialed scan

So when you run a credentialed scan, this type of scan can discover, if you will, vulnerabilities behind whatever you're using for authentication. Could be SSH key, certificate-based authentication, or username & password. 

So this has a potential, give you greater visibility and potentially greater amounts of vulnerabilities. It also allows you to determnie the impact, whether or not they were able to successfully exploit the system/network with said vulnerability. 
i.e. you can kinda see what the outcome is gonna be when we say determining the impact.

Credentialed                                    Discovers vulns beyond an auth mechanism 
- SSH key                                       can find > amount of vulns
- Certificate
- username & password

Non-credentialed                                Provide an outside(r) view
                                                (True Black Box Test. i.e. you have no information about the system and or network you are scanning)

Intrusive Vs. Non-intrusive Scan Types

Intrusive                                   Very Aggressive
                                            can be disruptive (System/Network Crashes )
                                            Helps determine impact

WARNING!!: If you crash a Database server you could potentially corrupt/destroy the data
Remember any time a system crashes and doesn't go through a graceful shutdown, especially if it's something like a database server, you can destroy or corrupt your information. So be aware of what your scanning and more importantly what type of scan your using

Non-intrusive                               Less aggressive
                                            Information gathering                                
                                            Less disruptive 

This scan is less aggressive, this is more, hey, I wanna find out what can I see, what information can I gather. But we're not gonna disrupt those systems or we're going to be less disruptive than our previous aggressive/intrusive counterpart

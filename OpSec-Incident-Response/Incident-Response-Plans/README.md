=============================================================================================

Incident Response Team

Who has the authority within the company and who has the jurisdiction? Remember, when we're dealing with incident response, there could be things like data breaches, there could be a lot of legality going behind this. So it is important to find out who are the people that are going to be reported to, who are the people that can actually kick off the entire response, incident response plan and the processes.

IT Security Team
It could be things and typically is some kind of IT security team. You might have a small business and those poor network administrator systems administrators could be wearing multiple hats. So it really depends on the size of the organization.

Technical Experts
We talk about technical experts, think about your system admins, your network admins, right? Think about your developers, if you will. So architecture, right? What systems do we even have running within our network? And then what kind of software are we running, right? So people that can look at the APIs, they know the code, right? So we really wanna bring in that technical expertise.

Law Enforcement
And then at the end of the day, there might be a potential that you need to bring in something like law enforcement. So these are examples of the ladies and gentlemen that might be part of the Incident Response Team. But it definitely starts at the top with the authority, who has the jurisdiction to say, all right, we can see that an incident's happen.

These teams make up some highly skilled people. And they might even make up just some regular folks that are in the IT department that have a specialized piece of knowledge about business operations and things of that nature. You can even outsource incident response teams. You can say, "Hey, I got the money and the wherewithal, let me just hire a team that I know these crack. Investigators know exactly what they're doing, they're gonna come in, they're gonna take over, they're gonna make it awesome."

These people can do digital forensics like no one's business. So it might be a blending of the two things. It's really important to build out a great team so that you can have a great plan, people that are gonna execute that plan. 

Stakeholder Management

How do they get notified? Who are the responsible people, if you will for doing the notification? When do they get notified? Again, because of the fact that we might have some contractual agreement NDA in place. We might have something where we can't disclose personally identifiable information. So how do we do that? At the end of the day, it comes down to how do we support the stakeholders? 

Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
We also have things like our Business Continuity Plan. When we talk about the Business Continuity Plan, how are we gonna maintain our operations? And basically make sure that the company doesn't fall short? How will we maintain the functional operation to survive? We need the company to survive a potential incident. 

Disaster and Recovery Plan (DRP)
And we also have things like Disaster and Recovery Plans. Where we talk about Business Continuity Plans are focused on the incident and keeping and maintaining the organization. VS a Disaster Recovery,which focuses on things like man made and natural disasters. 

It's important to understand, what are the actual steps that are gonna be put in place should some kind of man made or natural disaster happen? So that again, maybe we have a transference. We talked about things like for instance, our recovery sites, right? Are we going to fail over to a hot site? Are we gonna fail over to a warm site, if you will? So that all has to be a part of this.


Communications Plan 
The Communication Plan is very, very important, right? Because who do we talk to, all right? We talk to management, right? We talk to our team members, part of the incident response team. How do we talk to the stakeholders? Do we have things like HR, public relations, right? Do we have an out facing interest that we need to talk to, stakeholders being one of them? Who is gonna actually do that communication? And we need to make sure that it's thoroughly documented.

BCDRP (Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan)

And I'll tell you, even though we see in your objectives, you'll see this term business continuity and disaster recovery plan kind of separated, a lot of times today you're gonna see BCDR, right? Which is just the business continuity and disaster recovery plan at the end there, right? So you'll see two of these, a lot of the mindset working to the same goal. How do we maintain our operation so that we don't lose productivity? If there's some kind of natural disaster or man made disaster, how do we fail over? How do we, again, get back online as well?

SPECIAL NOTE:
Well, I'll tell you, in my years of my youth, I'm definitely I like to get my hands dirty like to do stuff. And I see things like this and I go boring, it's just procedural things. But I cannot stress to you how important it is to have something like that communications plan. That there is, you know who you're supposed to contact when things get rough. Because if you don't know that, you're standing there going, well, I guess I can send out an email. But email server's down, what do I do? Who do I contact? How do I contact them? What is the "Oh no, right? You can see how this can really, so as my years of wisdom have gained Wes' his advice here to have things of that nature is extremely important. 

Retention Policy

Retention Policy. Once these things have gone on, we have to make sure they're thoroughly documented, right? Because at the end of the day, there might be some kind of criminal. And I'm not saying there is or civil litigation. You have stakeholders, and maybe it costs them money, right? It's not good enough to just say, well, we had a problem. Well, we fixed it, now we're gonna move on. No, you need thorough documentation. So you might have a retention policy that states, something like this goes on how long do we retain all of the documentation, all of the communication, all of the findings, right? At the end of the day, so definitely remember the retention policy. That is part of your incident response plan as well.

Continuity of Operations
    United State initiative PPD-40
    Federal Government departments
    Essential operations during emergencies

We talk about continuity of operations, really what we're talking about is a presidential initiative as I call it. You'll see this one is not a United States initiative PPD, if you will. 40, just means presidential. It's a directive, right? We can see that these are the ways that federal government departments, how do they maintain their central operations during an emergency? One of the first ones that we've seen in this in this fashion actually happened September 11 of 2001. That was one of the first times you've seen it where George Bush, put together that presidential directive that says, this is how the federal government and the departments that are affected, ow they're gonna maintain operations through emergencies. We put it here cuz it's part of the objectives. But keep in mind this is more of a government or a federal government type initiative.


Exercises
- Tabletop
Tabletop, just think of it as a discussion. This is basically, let's sit down, let's solicit open communication and let's go through a brainstorming process, is your tabletop exercises.

- Walkthroughs
Now a walkthrough is more of a step by step each process, with each team member walking through portions of the incident response plan. So each team member can become trained and actively aware of their individual responsibilities. Let's go ahead and take that step by step methodical approach through each portion of the incident response plan, so every team member knows what their priorities are and what their roles are in mitigating this incident. 

- Simulation
Now simulations are where we're really gonna go in depth. Now that doesn't mean that it has to be a company wide exercise. It could be, it could be a completely organizational wide exercise or it could be, simulate an incident on these two systems within our network and let's see how we respond to them, 

EX: Dan here you know as part of the red team. Dan, I need you to attack this system. Let's find out what happens, right? And let's see how our more than anything, let's see how our team responds to this.

Resources:

This is such an important topic that there's a organization called Black Hills Information Security. They created a tabletop game based off of Dungeons and Dragons kind of idea. Where you roll dice and you have cards and you play it's a lot of fun. We played it and you do incident response with the card game. It's really interesting.

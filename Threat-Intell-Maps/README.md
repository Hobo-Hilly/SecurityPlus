# Threat Feeds

Real-time data streams of data providing information on potential cyber threats and risks

# Information Examples

Domains with poor reputation

- Known Malware

- IP addresses known for malicious activity

- Machine readable data that can be feed into security information and event management (SIEM systems).

# IoC - pieces of data that identify malicious activity

- STIX and TAXII standardize IoC documentation and reporting

- FireEye - Redline (free IoC monitoring tools) https://www.fireeye.com/services/freeware/redline.

- Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) enables the exchange of cyber threat indicators between the Federal Government, SLTT(State, Local, 
Tribal and Territorial) governments, and the private sector at machine speed.

# Threat feed examples

- DHS - AIS participants connect to a DHS-managed system in the Departmentâ€™s National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center 
(NCCIC) that allows bidirectional sharing of cyber threat indicators.

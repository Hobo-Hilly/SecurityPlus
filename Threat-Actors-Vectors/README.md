Threat Actor Types
''
- Threat actors. This is a classification of the bad people we have out there.
- You need to be aware of whether they're internal, whether they're external,
''

Script Kiddies
''
- Script kiddies is a derogatory term inside of the hacker community.
- Script kiddies are called that because they're typically piggybacking off of the know how/talent, of trained actors.
EX: "Grab a tool off the internet, it does X, cool. I ran the tool, it didn't work again instead, I ran it again, it didn't run again instead. I ran it again, it worked, great. I have no idea how it worked, it just did, and I'm a hacker"

''
Insider threats
''
- Insider threats are typically people that are working for your company. And are a lot of times they're authorized users that have access to potential sensitive information, confidential information, trade secrets
- So the insider threat mounts an attack that causes some kind of destructive nature inside of the company and causes some harm to your network or your data.
- So all of those securities that are in place for outside threats, they bypass very easily because they're already allowed on your network.

Hacktivist
''
- They want to attack some kind of company, maybe for a philosophical or some kind of political nature, that's going to be the hacktivist
- Hacking for the purposes of some kind of social change, they thought there was a social injustice and that's what they attch their motives two. 
''
Advanced persistent threat (APT)
"
- an APT is such a threat to a lot of networks. Definitely a very sophisticated group, And not just single person but group of people. A lot of times they're going to have, things like even governments backing them.

- So they be very well financed making them all the more dangerous

State actors
- State actors, more commonly reffered to as Nation State Actors. 
- These are the governments that are behind/ bankrolling the State Actors
- Again making them all the more dangerous

FYI: These are very advanced threats. NOT an APT, but again they could be using eachother.
You'll see these groups 'while maybe not officially connected to any government agency' they can still turnup working directly with the nation state.


Criminal syndicates
''
- Silk Road, you know it's been taken down, but this was a criminal organization that was working on the dark web for the purposes of selling drugs, human trafficing, Hitmen, just about anything under the sun.

- A lot of times they can be associated with an entire country

- Don't forget, big traditional criminal syndication as well. The mob, Italian mob, Russian Mob Italian Mob etc 

- All these other different mobs, they're still making money, they're just moving into the digital era 
''


Shadow IT
''
- The use of information technology systems, devices, software, applications, and services without explicit IT department approval.
- When employeess bring in there own devices and connect to the network. The problem is it sits outside of the knowledge of the IT staff or the IT team that would be their securing it.
    # EX: Using Dropbox or Google drive instead of company authorized storage (Software based)
    
    # EX: I wanna bring in my own access point, accidentally I bring in a rogue access point I have my own cellphone now because I want access to my stuff, my emails when I need access to them. The company needs to protect that phone with things like multi factor authentication. And ensure that the device is encrypted (Hardware based)
    
    # EX: We like development operations working together, what happens if those developers pull down some kind of container to use to create this environment for their runtime environment. And then they leave it orphaned(dont disspose of the container properly or secure it or even close it at times? Now you've got proprietary code sitting up there in the cloud that the IT team isn't aware of and they can't secure it and it's running contrary to security policy and again, violates that CIA principle that we're talking about.(Cloud based)
    
    # EX: Or worse, they're using some technology with inside of that container that has a known vulnerability(Cloud based)

- And this boils down shadow IT, things that are outside of the sphere, the scope, the awareness of IT team that could be a violation of security policy, which is really what a security breach 

- Shadow IT, can happen in a few different categories. This could be hardware based, software-based, or even be cloud-based.
''
Competitors
''
- This is in the list, but this really kind of works like an insider threat. Your competitors, they know you have some kind of trade secret. 

# EX: Edison vs Tesla
"Tesla was a great scientist, he was a very bad businessman. Edison on the other hand, he was a really good businessman, maybe not such good on the science part, but he definitely had people working with him"

- So competitors could be the ones that are trying to steal your information, disrupt your business.

- If they disrupt your business, they can pull ahead of you in the competition. But it could also be to steal your information likewise to.
''
Hackers vs. Attackers

Attackers are allways bad that is the very nature of the naming convention. "Attacker"

The term "Hacker" has a fairly negative connotaion in that people think of a dude sitting behind a desk doing nafarious shit. Well there are different types of Hackers,    

White hat
''
white hat that is actually doing this to expose a vulnerability, a weakness and exploit so that vendors can be aware of it. They can patch the systems up, and then turn around and make their end users aware of it
''

Black hat
''
- Black hats are typically somebody that is gonna do this for some kind of malicious terror or malicious reason, probably make a little bit of money themselves
''

Gray hat
''
# EX: Marcus Hutchins was hailed as a hero in May 2017 when he found a “kill switch” that slowed the effects of the WannaCry virus affecting more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries.

- Gray hats though, we're just meaning that. Maybe by day, I'm a systems administrator. I do security for an organization. And at night I go to work for an organized crime and I'm stealing trade secrets for the opposite company that I work for and giving it to the bad actors. So i'm working in both capacities.

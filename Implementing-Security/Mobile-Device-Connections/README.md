# This is all about cell phones and how they make their connections to the interwebs.

Connection methods and receivers

Cellular
- IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity)
    World wide hardware identifier (this is like the MAC address on a computer )
    uses GSM and UTMS networks (Global Systems for Mobile)
    (universal mobile telecommunications service)
     Has potential for spoofing
- IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)
    Worldwide unique subscriber identifier
    Uses GSM and UTMS
    Stored in SIM card (Subscriber Identity Modules)

WiFi

IEEE 802.11* Standard
Specifications (Most commonly used 4)

802.11b- AKA Wi-Fi 1 (11 Mbps, 2.4 GHz)

802.11a- AKA Wi-Fi 2 (54 Mbps, 5 GHz)

802.11g- AKA Wi-Fi 3 (54 Mbps, 2.4 GHz)

NFC (Near Field Communications)
- Short Range
- (10cm/4 inches)
- 13.56 MHz base frequency
- Simple setup
- File/Data transfer

Infrared
- Short Range
- Very Sensitive
- 1 meter/3.28 ft
- LoS Line of site communication
- 16 Mbps

Bluetooth
- Data Transfer
- Fixed and Mobile devices
- Discovery and pairing
- 2.4 GHz spectrem
- 1.0,1.2(legacy) = 732 Kbps
- 2.0 2.1 (+EDR) = 3 Mbps ( Enhanced Data Rate)
- 3.0 (+HS) = Mbps
- 4.0/4.2 (+BLE) = 3 Mbps Bluetooth Low Energy 

USB
FYI: Up to about 126 devices can be connected to just a single port.
- Point-to-point
 Used for Data Transfer
Standards...
    1.1 (Full Speed) = 12 Mbps
    2.0 (High Speed) = 480 Mbps
    3.2 Gen 1 (Super Speed) = 5 Gbps
    3.2 Gen 2 (Super Speed+) = 10 Gbps 
    3.2 Gen 2x2 (Super Speed 10Gbps) = 20 Gbps
    4.0 (USB4 Gen3x2 40 Gbps) = 40 Gbps



- Point-to-multipoint

Global Positioning System (GPS)
- There are 3 Major Components
    * Space Segment 
    24 Satalites positioned around the world with 3 on standby
    
    * Control segment
    The segment control is what is the worldwide monitoring system in the control stations

    * User Segment
    GPS receiver. AKA Your cellular device

Global Navigation Satellite Systems
    GPS(US)
    GLONASS(Russia)
    Galileo(EU)
    BeiDou(China)

These are some of the various standards when it comes to the global positioning system. And it is a form of a mobile device communication, or connection.

This is all Physical Sec! 
Gaurds Gates Guns
This is the protection of servers and computers itself.


All Physical Security

Bollards, barricades, fencing
- Physically stops people from walking on to the front lawn
Mantraps
- Very similar to a turn style
- Protects against tailgating and piggy backing
Alarms
Signage

Closed captions systems

Camera and CCTV

Again, motion is gonna require movement of some type, object recognition is just the fact that it can detect that something's in that camera and pan right to it and maybe even zoom in on it a little bit more

- Motion detection/recognition

- Object detection

Faraday Cage
- A Faraday cage. What it does is it blocks electromagnetic interference.

# How does it work?
You put your wallet in there, right and you can have somebody just casually doing things like card reading if you will and the other ones that we have actually you could put entire servers in there. They have a corporate enterprise level building shielding too where it doesn't allow electromagnetic interference coming in and it doesn't allow that electromagnetic emanation, if you will, outside. Because believe it or not, even though they're highly sophisticated attacks, there is the ability to know what you're doing based on electromagnetic emanations outbound.

# Where would you see it?

 I think of those Tempest attacks where they're able to actually read the electronic emanations from like a monitor and recreated on a different monitor so they can see through walls to Rick's because they're just grabbing that that emanation out from the clear blue sky as it were, and recreating it right there on a different screen.

# Summary
So Just know that the Faraday cage it prevents electromagnetic energy from radiating out of whether it's a server whether it's a network device or sometimes it's is it as large as an entire building or room

USB data blockers
- What we're talking about are physical devices that can be plugged into the ports of machines that don't allow that information to be transferred. 

Protected cable distribution

- Protected cable distribution too. You also have things like wall Jacks that somebody could just plug into and potentially have access to your network. So even though it's not on the list, it is part of a physical security.

-  And while you have other things within your switches that you can do like things like port security, so making sure that even if they do plug in the switch isn't going to allow them to communicate. But remember the physical level you can also start that just by having those basically port covers that block anybody from plugging down into your network. 




Sensors

FYI: Also we have to worry about things like climate control. So for instant moisture detectors. That's important because remember, you do need a little a certain level of humidity within your data centers but too much will lead to condensation and can lead to short circuiting. If we don't have enough moisture or any moisture that could be electrostatic discharge which can ruin your circuitry. So you definitely need some kind of climate control system if you will.

Smartcards
- PIN
- Key fob

- Cable locks

Guards
- Guard is there to Respond to Alarms 

Reception
- Visitors logs
- Access control rosters

- Access Control Roster as well. Right, so it's basically about keeping track about who's coming in and who's going out of the building.

- Robot Sentries

- Two person controls(Seperation of Duties. Not one person has all the power)

Physical Security - Secure Areas

Air gapped networks/systems
- Not attached to any outside internet
Well, we're gonna just lend ourselves to the old prior networking days, the good old sneaker net, right, where you're not going to actually have these systems connected to any network. So for instance, I believe the highest level of our time servers out there, I don't even believe they're connected to any direct networks.

- They have to make physical serial based connections into them to communicate with them. Now, you might say, well, wait a second, I connected time servers all the time.
-  That's why they call them air gapped. There is no direct network connection to them.


Vaults and Safes


Hot isle/cold isle

- It's a strategic basically like a HVAC system that moves hot air and cold air strategically to help cool your data center. A lot of times what you'll see down here at the bottom is a raised floor.
- Crack, I think it's great. It's the Computer Room Air Conditioning system. It's basically the device that maintains, monitors the temperature, the air distribution.
- it's just a strategically placed climate control system that moves the hot air and the cold air and circulates it so that your data centers aren't overheating.

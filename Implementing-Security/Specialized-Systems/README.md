This is all about specialized systems!!

SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)

Industrial Control Systems 

Critical Infrastructure


Types
    Facilities
    Industrial
    Manufacturing
    Energy
    Logistics
        logistics when we think about it's just a coordination of complex operations and it involves a lot of moving parts, a lot of people, transportation delivery systems if you will, all kind of working together and these systems have to be secure. 

FYI: These systems used to kind of had security baked into them because they were air gapped, isolated, highly secured. And then we started bolting on insecure technologies to make our lives more easy.


IoT (Internet of Things)

FYI: So IOT is important to understand in general just because they're predicting by the end of 2025 that we could see up to upwards of 27 to 30 billion of these devices connected to network.

FYI: Sensors can be built into even things like SCADA systems

Components
- Sensors
- Smart Devices
- Alexa
- Cameras
- Refrigerators
- Wearables Apple Watch/ Galaxy Watch
- Smart Meters (Solar Controls/ Sprinklers)
- facility Automation

Embedded Systems
- Raspberry Pi
- Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
- And these devices again is just a circuit that can be programmed and controlled.
FYI: These are vulnerable to attacks. One is named 'Star Bleed'

- Arduino
- Arduino is just another type of embedded system.
- You might hear sometimes, as well thrown around with embedded systems is SOC really just means system on a chip
- It means we've got a lot of that functionality built into the single a single processor put on a PCB or printed circuit board
- SOC (System on a Chip) That can really provide the functionality of a full blown computer today whether it's the power it's there's power constraints, but for the most part, no, no a little bit about these embedded systems

- Medical Systems
- HVAC (Heating and Ventilation Systems)
- Vehicles/ Aircrafts/ Drones

- RTO's (Real Time Operating Systems)


Surveillence systems
VoIP
MFD Printers





Specialized and Embedded System Communications
- 5G
     Low, Mid, and High-Band Spectrum
     100 times faster than 4G
     Greater network capacity

- Narrow-band
    Lower transmit power
    Low cost
    NB-IoT ( Narrow Band IoT Communications)
    LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network Communications)

- Baseband radio
    A frequency prior to modulation

- Zigbee
    Zigbee's the one that follows into the 802.15.4 specification.
    And these are used in things like home automation, medical monitoring have accessors. And they can control a lot of systems with Zigbee
    low power/data rates
    Zigbee using something known as the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance, which is a. Fancy way to say it uses the same type of access method that Wi-Fi uses and again that's that IEEE 802.15.4 standard,

- LR-WPANs ( Low Rate Wide Personal Area Network)


# Security concerns

Cryptographic concerns
- No encryptions
- Weak encryption
Authentication concerns
- Poorly developed web User Interfaces (Web UI's)
- Weak authentication
- Insecure Defaults
- Default is Implied Trust!!

Cost associated with Risk
- Sensitive data in excessive amounts

Patch Management
- Decentralized
- Propriatary
- Heterogeneous devices 
Heterogeneous just means I can have all these different types of devices made by different vendors so. Patch management can become a problem in these devices t

Physical Security
- RTU (Remote Telemetry Units)
    These send wireless communications on what the sensor is picking up
- Geographically Dispersed


FYI: but dial-up, you know, it starts out baseband radio is just a frequency essentially prior to its modulation that's then transmitted If you will, over radio links

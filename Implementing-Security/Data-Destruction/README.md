This is all about secure data destruction

Burning



Shredding
- Security Levels (These are cross cut and each level is smaller and smaller)
    P2-P6
    P4 = Commercial Level
    P5 = Espionage Proof
    P6 = DoD/NSA, Military

Pulping
- Recycling paper
- Reducing documents to a paper slurry 

Overwriting
- Writing new Data over deleted data
- DoD 5220.22 data sanatization standard
- multiple passed 
pass 1 = writes 0's over the data
pass 2 = writes 1's over the data
pass 3 = overriding all addressable locations with a random bit pattern
pass 4 = verifying all the prior passes actually performed the way they were supposed to

Pulverizing
- Destroying the Media the data is stored on
- Trash Compactor which breaks the physical devices down to post stamp size
- 

Degaussing
- Uses very strong magnets

# how does it work?

-It's called strong magnets essentially. And they have devices like such as this one right here, that will actually allow you to feed in drives, and the more drives you can feed in at one time, typically the more expensive these devices get, 

and they can be 1000s of 10s of 1000s of dollars. And you can have a machine like this that actually the Gauss isn't for you and again, the goal here is Is to completely scramble all of the information where the override is a piece of software that actually overwrites the information. 

#FYI VERY VERY expensive


Incineration
- Complete destruction of all media components
- We are liquifing the data
- You can have a company do this for you

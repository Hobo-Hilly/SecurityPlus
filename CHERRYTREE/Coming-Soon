I am currently in the middle of re-doing my notes for all Security+ in cherry tree. The ability to cut and paste with such ease along with the myriad of other advantages Cherry Tree offers made it a no brainer. I will still be doing notes in visual code. But things like networking notes and anything that involves a lot of slides in the lesson plan will probably only be done in Cherry Tree. I do not want to ASCii Draw every set up to every example every time.

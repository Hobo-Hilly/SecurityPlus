# Summary 
EX:
Picture this ..
Now, I know inside of your home right now you've probably are looking at your computer. Maybe you see some cables, whether you actually installed or not, doesn't matter. But then there's a certain point where that cable leaves your house, goes underground, wherever it goes, typically, underground, and hits a telephone pole, or what stays underground, and it disappears. 

Do you really know where all of that infrastructure is? Do you really know where inside of this Internet thing we call, that infrastructure is? Well, you've been using cloud based technologies and you probably didn't realize it for a very long time. And I want you to think of the Internet, all right? 

It's kinda like the precursor to the cloud. Do you know what's going on? Do you know the hardware? Do you own the hardware? That's when you send, let's say, an email from yourself to maybe a relative across seas or on the other side of the country? No, right? Just kinda goes off into the ether, all right? Well, that's almost kind of like a concept of a cloud. 

============================================================================================================

Cloud Computing
- cloud computing is formally, defined as delivery of computing services over the Internet 
- "it's basically using someone elses network."
- " the cloud and the internet are equal " i.e. If I go out to an Internet website, that's somebody else's computer that's hosting that website, giving me that service, allowing me to access that resource.
- We do not own the 
    Servers
    Storage Devices
    Hardware
     routers
     firewalls
     switches

This is all to deliver a service to end users all over the internet. The are providing 'compute'. i.e. CPU power, Memmory, Hard Drives, Networking devices, network adapters etc ...

EX:
When you use Gmail, is any of that hardware yours, or are you just basically opening a web application and you're typing in whatever your email is or checking your email, right? No, Google, right? Google takes care of all of that for you.

Cloud Service Provider
- aws
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform

EX:
Cloud service providers CSPs, again, they're the organizations that will allow you to use their networks, right? When we say you're using somebody else's hardware, you're using somebody else's network. Well, these are the three major players within this space that are allowing, for a fee, you to use their infrastructure. 


FYI: Internet service providers were kind of like a precursor to cloud service providers.
They gave you access to this massive infrastructure that you had no clue to what's going on. I just know when I connect to it, I can play my online game or I can send an email, check websites, read fourms etc. But none of the infrastructure is mine.



Tenant, Multi-tenant, and tenant isolation
- Tenant: a tenant, is a single customer within a cloud provider's network
- Multi-tenant: multiple customers within a cloud provider
- tenant isolation: No tenant has access to any other tenant in any capacity

EX: Tenant isolation - What that means is, like we talk about in virtualization, where you have these isolated instances, multiple isolated instances of operating systems that run on a single physical device, that virtualization software allows something like Microsoft and Amazon and Google to allow more than one customer to run within their networks. But, they are isolated from one another. i.e. Company 3 cannot go in and peer into Company 2's infrastructure that they are leasing or renting, if you will, for that service. 


On-demand Self-service
- This on demand self service means I don't have to contract somebody to go buy me a server, install it in the data center. No, I just open a web browser and I say I want this and I want it now.

Broad Network Access
- You can access your cloud computing power from ANY device

Resource Pooling
- That's why they call it a pool. You can have your portion of the pool
EX:
If i've got 10 servers, right? I can say all right, two are gonna go to this company, you're gonna utilize two of those servers, two are gonna go to this company and two are gonna go to this company. 

It's a larger pool of resources. But that we can individually allocate portions of it to various companies that are using our service that's essentially resource pooling.


Rapid Elasticity
- This is the ability essentially for resources to be assigned without service interruption 
- Well, rapid elasticity is the ability to rapidly scale your infrastructure On Demand 
- Scaling out is when you need to provide a service. So what you do is you add more instances of something
- Scalilng up is taking a single instance and adding more power to it


Measured Service
- This means is that everything that you're doing is metered and measured
- Helps customers and service providers determine exactly how much money is needed

The measurement allows the Cloud provider and the customer to keep track of the resources that they're using as part of their subscription.

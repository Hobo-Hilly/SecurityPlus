Cloud Models - Public

- It's, available to the general public for public consumption for instance, if Dan has a company, maybe he's into security service provider. And he wants to start his own company, he can go to a public cloud, he can gain access to it, same public cloud provider, I can do the same thing.

# How is it deployed? 
- Well, they've already deployed the infrastructure and the majority of the infrastructure is owned by them, if not all, usually about 100% of it is owned by them. And then you pay them a service to have access, like Dan said in an earlier episode, essentially to somebody else's network.

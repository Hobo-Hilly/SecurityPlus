Cloud Models - Public

- It's, available to the general public for public consumption for instance, if Dan has a company, maybe he's into security service provider. And he wants to start his own company, he can go to a public cloud, he can gain access to it, same public cloud provider, I can do the same thing.

# How is it deployed? 
- Well, they've already deployed the infrastructure and the majority of the infrastructure is owned by them, if not all, usually about 100% of it is owned by them. And then you pay them a service to have access, like Dan said in an earlier episode, essentially to somebody else's network.


Cloud Models - Private

- The private cloud, but in this aspect, it's not open for general public consumption. It's only that one business that's gonna have access to the data within it and the infrastructure surrounding it.
-  You could have a private cloud that is completely owned, operated, managed and maintained, from the ground up by just a specific company. Now that's becoming one of these things that isn't quite as popular. Now you might still be doing something like this or if you have compliance, some kind of legality where you have to control all of your information.

Cloud Models - Community
- Two organizations that have a common goal sharing the same infrastructure
EX: Insurance provider and a Medical Practice
    - both share similar goals
    - Security compliance concerns
    - So they share a portion of each others infrastructure

HR Deparment sharing portions with the public relations Departments as well
    - both share similar goals
    - Security compliance concerns
    - So they share a portion of each others infrastructure

Cloud Models - Hybrid
    - It is a blending of one or more model types from above
    - We have a portion of our resources in the cloud and a portion on prem
    we now have communication between these two infrastructures
So maybe the company has a data center with in their network INSIDE on the their LAN
But they also have a connection out to the cloud where a portion on their network remains

On the edge of the networks communicating between infrastructures is a Router known as a 'Transit Gateway' This is the way IN and OUT of your cloud network. You may or may NOT have control over the Gateway depending on how you have your cloud services set up.

So that's edge computing, essentially allows the devices to do their own calculations and then we can store that information locally. And we can get that real time information back to us, rather than some of the delay or the latency, by sending it over the public networks, getting it routed all the way up over the internet, if you will, into the cloud providers network and then coming back and returning that information to us

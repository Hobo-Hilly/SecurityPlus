Cloud Computing
# How does it work?
EX:
Cloud computing providers network, they have all the resources. They process the information, they store the information. And then the information is typically returned to us in a form of a web browser.

IoT devices, there can be billions of them scattered everywhere entire sensor Nets. Little remote telemetry units, in things like scada based systems if you will which for the most part have been air-gapped. But now we're connecting them and have been for a while to TCP IP based networks.

 Now when we talk about cloud computing and the concept of IoT devices, a lot of times we need real-time analysis, right? We need that information to be computed and we need it given back to us, so that we can do real-time analysis on it. 
 
 So for instance, think about sensors if you will, that control the heat to a certain factory, right? Or maybe a sensor that's detecting water that raises or lowers some kind of floodgate, if you will, right? We don't want that information taking a long time. 
 
 And if you look at the fact that a lot of times these data centers can have a great geographical distance between them, that can introduce a little bit of latency by sending that information into the cloud waiting for it to be processed and then returned to us

Edge Computing

Fog Computing

Managed Service Providor (MSP)

Managed Security Servicer Provider (MSSP)

Software-defined networing (SN)


So that's edge computing, essentially allows the devices to do their own calculations and then we can store that information locally. And we can get that real time information back to us, rather than some of the delay or the latency, by sending it over the public networks, getting it routed all the way up over the internet, if you will, into the cloud providers network and then coming back and returning that information to us

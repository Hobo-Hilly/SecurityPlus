iven a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack.

Description:In this episode, the viewer will dive into the world of malware as we compare and contrast the most common malware types such as worms, trojans, rootkits, ransomware bots and more.

Malware (What is it?)

''
This is a type of virus. 
Malware is a kind of malicious unauthorized code that attaches itself to a host application/file to gain unauthorized access in some shape or form. 

"" 

Virus
''
Attaches itself to some type of host file/process/application/executable of some sort to make its way on to the computer.
Has to be activated by host. Requires some type of host interaction to acticvate.
''

Virus Types

Macro
''
Mini applications that inhance the functionality of a major application.
Ex: Microsoft Excel Spread sheets. They use macro funtions to enhance opperability. If you receive an excel spread sheet with the macros enabled you can potentially be compromised by having malicious code stored in the macros which will execute when called by the program.
''
Boot-sector
''
When the firmware is done initializing the hardware and looks to your (SSD, HHD, m.2) media storage device to find the small bit of code used to bootstrap the Operating system so it can take over the hardware.

If a VIRUS has infected the boot sector of your storage device. Then the VIRUS will bootstrap the Operating System instead of the legit software
''

Attachment
''
These are commonly attached to emails. If you don't know who it's from do not ever open the attachment.
''

File Infector
''
This is where the code to the virus is stored in an already executable program. Like a game or application of some sort.

''

Polymorphic
''
This virus is desinged to morph from time to time to avoid creating a signature that is detectable by anti-viruses.
Anti-Viruses have a database of common viruse signatures. A ploymorphic virus is designed to shape shift into different variants of itself so that it cant be detected on your machine.

VERY DANGEROUS!

''

Network
''
This is a virus that propagates through the network 

''


Worms
''
What makes a worm different from other malware? It's self sufficient. It's self-replicating. It doesn't need host interaction. It can sit outside your network waiting for a port of entry and once it sees a hole. Away it goes.
They typically like to eat resources
- network bandwidth
- storage
- memory 
- CPU computaional power 
Can eat up your server recources then it can pop over to your wireless network and start to eat up your wireless network buffer.
This is a nasty piece of malware. And again viruses need host interaction to become active. WORMS DO NOT need any interaction at all.
''

Fileless
''
These viruses do not posess any signatures. So you wont find them in an AV Database.
This virus never touches disk(harddrive). It is ran all in volitile memory
Typical Order of Operation
1- phishing email sent to traget(victim) with malicious attachment
2- Victim opens attachment
3- The malicious code is executed in memory so it technically never touches a disk(fileless)
4- Hacker now has desired outcome of code execution

''
RootKit
''
- These are devistating. Very hard to get rid of.
- These are called root kits because of the privilleged access that goes with it.
- Difficult to detect
    Because the malware has such Low-level access(High Privileged access) when the software sends information down to the kernal (Linux kernal/NT kernal)
    if the malware is with the kernal or right there next to the CPU the machine has no idea its there. So the malware can tell the machine whatever it wants and beacuse the command is coming from such a low level access point the machine will execute the commands it's given with no questions askeed.
The kernal performs these actions for us and sends information back to the anti malware solution. 

- SUDO (linux/unix Super User Do)
- NT\Authority (Windows)
- Administrator(Windows)

Keyloggers

-  If software based. It's a byproduct of malware
- Desinged to capture raw keyboard input
-  It can be a physical device. Like a rubber ducky

Backdoors
- They behave a lot like a torjan
- Software-based 
    Malware
    Applications 
- Creating an ADMIN user that no one knows about


Logic Bombs
- sits dormant 
- uses a condtion as a trigger
    time
    date
    Action
    inaction


Demo creating a user in Active Directory

Keyloggers

Can be installed by most of these malware types

Could be a byproduct of malware attack

Ransomware
''
- Victims have to pay for attackers to gain money

- Cryptomalware - Does not require a response from the victim or payment for attackers to make money
''

Bots

Botnets

Command and control

Bots

Trojan

Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs)

- Identity = Who are you?
- Authentication = prove it
- Authorization = What can you do?
- Accounting = What did you do?



Authorization and Authentication


- Identity: So identification is about establishing who you are
- Identity is something separate, that actually comes before we authenticate
- Could be your name/ username/ Identification Number

How do I prove that I am who I say I am?

- Password
- Fingerprint
- Smartcard

Authentication doesn't prove, truly you are who you say you are. What it is, is really a validation of a set of credentials

Authentication: 

Authorization Factors (Something you know)
(KBA)Knowledge-based authentication
    - Static KBA
    - Dynamic KBA

Authorization Factors (Something you have)
    - Smart Card
    - Jump Drive

Authorization Factors (Something you are)
    - Fingerprint
    - Facial Recognition
    - Retina scanner

FYI: If you combine two or more of these, you get multi factor authentication. You might hear it abbreviated MFA. Most commonly we hear to FA, that's a two-factor authentication. If you combine three, three factors, right, it's a multi factor, it's more than one


Authorization Factors (Somewhere you are)
- Geo Location
- Specified Networks/Ports allowed/not allowed


-Authorization
- What can you access?
- Log on to a workstation
- Print to a printer



-Accounting
What have you done?

Account Management - Password Keys
- YubiKey (external)
- Mobile Devices (external)
- Biometrics (internal)
- FIDO U2F, UAF, CTAP and FIDO2

FIDO = Fido is Fast Identity Online
- It's a set of open standards, if you will, that allows you a fast log-on experience across websites and applications
These are some of the standards below

U2F = Universal Second Factor

UAF = Universal Authentication Framework

CTAP = CTAP Is another one out there that's part of the W three C's web auth and FIDO2 combine

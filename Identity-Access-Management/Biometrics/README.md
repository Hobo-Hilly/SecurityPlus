All about biometrics

What is Biometrics Authentication (two slides)
- Something you are. Some kind of physical attribute of yourself

Biometrics Methods (two slides)

- Fingerprint
- Voice
- Hand Geometry scanner(Hand Print Scanner)
- Retina Scanner
- Iris Scanner
- Facial Recognition
- Veins (Cardio Vascualar verification) a fingerprint of your body's circulatory system. It's like a fingerprint for your veins.

Gait analysis is another type of authentication mechanism. Verify's you by your walking stride


Efficacy Rates

FRRc (False Rejection Rate)
- AKA Type 1 Error
- This is where an authorized user is REJECTED


FAR (False Acceptance Rate)
- AKA Type 2 Error
- When an unauthorized user is granted access 


CER (Crossover Error Rate )
- AKA Equal Error Rate
- The CER is where the FRR and the FAR are equal. That's why its AKA equal error rate. If this were on a graph. The point on the graph where the two points intersect or the two points cross over they are equal, hence the two terms 

This measurement examines your biometric system and defines how accurate the system is

- If the cross over rate is Higher that means LESS accurate
- And the lower the crossover or equal error rate is, the more accurate a system is

So this file is dedicated to the only real useful quotes involving Luci. "The Devil is in the Details" and "Better the Devil you know than the devil you don't." 

This is a list of Details and Definitions I believe to be useful is quick reference style and also useful for a study guide. I am going to type these all by hand in order to study and create at the same time. Before you ask, yes this is absolutely banana's and I am a bit mad for doing this. BUT... Once it's done I won't have to do it again. At least for this class.

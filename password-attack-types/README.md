- Topic: Threats, Attacks and Vulnerabilities Episode: Password Attacks Learner Objectives: Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack. 

- Description: In this episode, the viewer will identify various types of password- based attacks such as spraying, brute force, dictionary attacks, and rainbow tables.


What is a password attack?

-  This is an attack used against authentication systems/mechinisms.
-  These are automated processes most of the time. You can manually guess if you want but much easier to use a tool.

TYPES of attacks


Guessing
Brute Force: This means you are going to try every possible character combonation you can across the keyboard

Password Attacks * Brute Force
        - 0000
        - 0001
        - 0002
        - 0003

* This example is of a 4 digit bike lock 0-9 and 4 number values *
So again, Brute Force is going through every possible combonation the lock has to offer until you get it correct.
This attack can take a long time


Another type of Brute Force is the Dictionary attack
Dictionary

- This is going to take a list of passwords and run it against the authentication mechinism. Usually a list of commonly used passwords.


Rainbow Tables

- Rainbow tables are very fast
- The rainbow tables can take up a large amount of storage. You can get rainbow tables that are 8 - 9 Terabytes is size so pay attention
- The use precomputed chains (Already hashed passwords) it checks the hashed values of passwords instead of the asci|| values of passwords
 This cuts out the machine having to convert it which is why its so much faster. Hash Values are much larger then asci|| password values. Hence the size of the rainbow tables.

 Password Spraying:
- This is using one password against multiple accounts.
 
- If you were gain access to a list of users you coule take commonly used passwords and spray them against the users list.

- This is much more stealthy and can help you avoid account lockout mechinisms

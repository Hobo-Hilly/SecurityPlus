What is a password attack?

-  This is an attack used against authentication systems/mechinisms.
-  These are automated processes most of the time. You can manually guess if you want but much easier to use a tool.

TYPES of attacks


Guessing
Brute Force: This means you are going to try every possible character combonation you can across the keyboard

Password Attacks * Brute Force
        - 0000
        - 0001
        - 0002
        - 0003

* This example is of a 4 digit bike lock 0-9 and 4 number values *
So again, Brute Force is going through every possible combonation the lock has to offer until you get it correct.
This attack can take a long time
